# Bryan Hui's introduction page

Hello, my name is Bryan Hui. I am a second year student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a degree in computer science. This is 
a portfolio of all my personal and academic projects. 

## Completed Relevant Academic Courses

### Year 1: 
- CPSC 110 Computation, Programs and Programming
  - Learned to utilize design recipes (HtDF, HtDP) to build basic functions. Second half of the course had an emphasis on basic data structures, algorithms, and recursion
- CPSC 121 Models of Computation
  - Learned to write logical arguments, eventually used for proofs and building simple circuits. Basic introduction to memory, asymptotic analysis, DFAs and regex.  
- CPSC 210 Software Construction
  - Learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming using Java. Useful topics include testing, inheritance, exceptions, and design patterns. 

### Year 2:
- CPSC 221 Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Learned to employ and write various data structures (such as collections, trees and graphs) and algorithms (such as searching and sorting)
     with an emphasis on efficient time complexity and correctness. 


## Currently Learning
